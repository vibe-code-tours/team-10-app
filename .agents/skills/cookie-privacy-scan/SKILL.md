  Audit a site's cookies and trackers — inventory every cookie, flag missing
  Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite, list third-party trackers, and detect tracking
  that fires before consent. Playwright MCP only, no signup.

# Cookie & Privacy Scan

See what a site stores and who it tells before you click "Accept". No signup required.

## Prerequisites

- **Playwright MCP** (comes with Claude Code)

## Trigger

- "Cookie/privacy scan https://..."
- "What trackers are on my site?"
- "Am I setting cookies before consent?"

## Workflow

1. Navigate to the URL using `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` **without** clicking any
   consent banner yet — this is the pre-consent state.
2. Capture pre-consent cookies and storage with `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate`:

```javascript
() => ({
  cookies: document.cookie,
  localStorage: Object.keys(localStorage),
  sessionStorage: Object.keys(sessionStorage),
})
```

3. Capture network requests with `mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests` and flag any
   third-party calls to known tracker/analytics/ad domains that fired **before** consent.
4. If a consent banner is present, accept it (`mcp__playwright__browser_click`), then re-capture
   to compare before/after. Cookie attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`) come from the
   `set-cookie` response headers in the network log (JS-readable cookies are by definition not HttpOnly).
5. Grade:

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Tracking cookie / pixel set before consent | High (GDPR/ePrivacy risk) |
| Session cookie missing `Secure` on HTTPS | High |
| Session cookie missing `HttpOnly` | Medium |
| Cookie missing `SameSite` | Medium |
| Third-party tracker present | Info (list them) |

6. Output:

```
## Cookie & Privacy Scan: [URL]

**Pre-consent tracking detected — GDPR risk**

### Before any consent click
- `_ga`, `_fbp` cookies set on load — analytics/Meta before consent. ⚠
- Request to `connect.facebook.net` fired pre-consent. ⚠

### Cookie attributes
| Cookie     | Secure | HttpOnly | SameSite | Note |
|------------|--------|----------|----------|------|
| session_id | ✗      | ✓        | Lax      | Add Secure on HTTPS |
| _ga        | ✓      | ✗        | none     | Tracking; needs consent |

### Third-party trackers (5)
google-analytics.com · connect.facebook.net · doubleclick.net · hotjar.com · intercom.io

### Fixes
1. Gate analytics/ad scripts behind consent (don't load them on first paint).
2. Add `Secure` + `SameSite=Lax` to `session_id`.
