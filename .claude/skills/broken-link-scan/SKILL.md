# Broken Link Scanner

Find every broken link on a page. No signup required.

## Prerequisites

- **Playwright MCP** (comes with Claude Code)

## Trigger

- "Find broken links on https://..."
- "Check for 404s on my site"
- "Scan links on this page"

## Workflow

1. Navigate to the URL using `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
2. Extract all links using `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate`:

```javascript
() => {
  return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a[href]')).map(a => ({
    text: a.textContent.trim().substring(0, 50),
    href: a.href,
    isExternal: a.host !== location.host
  }));
}
```

3. For each link (up to 50), check status:
   - Internal links: navigate and check for error pages
   - External links: note them but don't crawl (avoid rate limits)
   - Flag: 404, 500, redirect chains, empty href, javascript:void

4. Output:

```
